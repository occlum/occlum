/// A queue for waiters.
///
/// By using this queue, we can wake up threads in their waiters' enqueue order.
///
/// While the queue is conceptually for `Waiter`s, it internally maintains a list
/// of `Waker`s.
///
/// Note about memory ordering:
/// Here count needs to be synchronized with wakers. The read operation of count
/// needs to see the change of the waker field. Just `Acquire` or `Release` needs
/// to be used to make all the change of the wakers visible to us.
///
/// Regarding the usage of functions like fetch_add and fetch_sub, they perform
/// atomic addition or subtraction operations. The memory ordering parameter for
/// these functions can be chosen from options such as `Relaxed`, `Acquire`, `Release`,
/// `AcqRel` and `SeqCst`. It is important to select the appropriate memory ordering
/// based on the corresponding usage scenario.
///
/// In this code snippet, the count variable is synchronized with the wakers field.
/// In this case, we only need to ensure that waker.lock() occurs before count.
/// Although it is safer to use AcqRelï¼Œhere using `Release` would be enough.
