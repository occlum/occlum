/// of the program, the execution order of statements can be rearranged. There is a control
/// dependency between flag and i. When the instruction is reordered, step 2 will write the
/// result value to the hardware cache, and when judged to be true, the result value will be
/// written to the variable i. Therefore, controlling dependency does not prevent compiler
/// optimizations
///
/// Note about memory ordering:
/// Here is_woken needs to be synchronized with host_eventfd. The read operation of
/// is_woken needs to see the change of the host_eventfd field. Just `Acquire` or
/// `Release` needs to be used to make all the change of the host_eventfd visible to us.
///
/// The ordering in CAS operations can be `Relaxed`, `Acquire`, `AcqRel` or `SeqCst`,
/// The key is to consider the specific usage scenario. Here fail does not synchronize other
/// variables in the CAS operation, which can use `Relaxed`, and the host_enent needs
/// to be synchronized in success, so `Acquire` needs to be used so that we can see all the
/// changes in the host_eventfd after that.
///
/// Although it is correct to use AcqRel, here I think it is okay to use Acquire, because
/// you don't need to synchronize host_event before is_woken, only later.
