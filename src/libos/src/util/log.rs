/// Log infrastructure.
///
/// There are five APIs for producing log messages:
/// 1. `error!`
/// 2. `warn!`
/// 3. `info!`
/// 4. `debug!`
/// 5. `trace!`
/// which corresponds to five different log levels.
///
/// To give all developers a common sense of "when to use which log level", we give some guidelines
/// and examples here:
///
/// 1. Use `errno!` to mark errors or unexpected conditions, e.g., a `Result::Err` returned from a
///    system call.
///
/// 2. Use `warn!` to warn about potentially problematic issues, e.g., executing a workaround or
///    fake implementation.
///
/// 3. Use `info!` to show important events (from users' perspective) in normal execution,
///    e.g., creating/exiting a process/thread.
///
/// 4. Use `debug!` to track major events in normal execution, e.g., the high-level
///    arguments of a system call.
///
/// 5. Use `trace` to record the most detailed info, e.g., when a system call enters
///    and exits the LibOS.
///
/// One of the most important principles for effective logging is "don't log too much or too little".
/// So log messages should be inserted with discretion.
///
/// Safety. Sensitive, internal info may be leaked though log messages. To prevent
/// this from happening, the current solution is to turn off the log entirely
/// when initializing the log infrastructure, if the enclave is in release mode.
///
/// Note. Do not use log as a way to display critical info to users as log may be
/// turned off (even the error messages). For such messages, use `println!` or
/// `eprintln!` directly.
