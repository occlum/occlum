Welcome to Occlum's documentation!
===================================

**Occlum** is a memory-safe, multi-process library OS (LibOS) for Intel SGX.
As a LibOS, it enables legacy applications to run on SGX with little or even no modifications of source code, thus protecting the confidentiality and integrity of user workloads transparently.
