# Install Occlum with Popular Package Managers

Occlum can be easily installed with popular package managers like [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)) and [RPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager). This document walks you through the steps to install Occlum on popular Linux distributions like Ubuntu and CentOS using package managers.

## Prerequisite

**Install enable_RDFSBASE Kernel Module**

If the Kernel version is before `v5.9`, please follow [this README](https://github.com/occlum/enable_rdfsbase/blob/master/README.md) to install `enable_rdfsbase` kernel module.

## Install Occlum with APT on Ubuntu 20.04

1. Install Prerequisite
```
apt update
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates gnupg2 jq make gdb wget libfuse-dev libtool tzdata rsync
```

2. Install Intel速 SGX Driver and Intel速 SGX PSW

Please follow [Intel SGX Installation Guide](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.13/docs/Intel_SGX_Installation_Guide_Linux_2.13_Open_Source.pdf) to install SGX driver and SGX PSW. SGX SDK is not required. Using PSW installer is recommanded.

To install PSW, follow the guide to add Intel速 SGX repository to APT source. And then run:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y libsgx-dcap-ql libsgx-epid libsgx-urts libsgx-quote-ex libsgx-uae-service libsgx-dcap-quote-verify-dev
```

After installing PSW, please make sure `aesm` service is in `active (running)` state by checking:
```
service aesmd status
```

3. Install Occlum
```
echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://occlum.io/occlum-package-repos/debian bionic main' | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/occlum.list
wget -qO - https://occlum.io/occlum-package-repos/debian/public.key | apt-key add -
apt-get update
apt-get install -y occlum
```

### Occlum toolchains packages

Besides, users can choose to install the toolchain installer based on the application's language. Currently, Occlum supports only `musl-gcc`, `glibc`. Users can install each one on demand.

```
apt install -y occlum-toolchains-gcc
apt install -y occlum-toolchains-glibc
```

### Occlum Runtime package

If users only expect to run the Occlum instance image, then `occlum-runtime` package is better choice for size reason.
```
apt install -y occlum-runtime
```
