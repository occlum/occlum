# Occlum Configuration

Occlum can be configured easily via a configuration file named `Occlum.yaml`, which is generated by the `occlum init` command in the Occlum instance directory. The user can modify `Occlum.yaml` to configure Occlum. The template of `Occlum.yaml` is shown below.

```yaml
# All the settings below can only take effect after `occlum build`.
resource_limits:
  # The heap size of LibOS kernel
  kernel_space_heap_size: 32MB
  # The stack size of LibOS kernel. If not sure, don't modify it.
  kernel_space_stack_size: 1MB
  # The total size of enclave memory available to LibOS processes.
  # This size should be adjusted per different applications.
  # If reports ENOMEM error, try increase this size.
  user_space_size: 256MB
  # The minimum and maximum OS threads used by LibOS. If not sure, don't modify them.
  min_num_of_cpus: 1
  max_num_of_cpus: 128
process:
  # Default stack size for each process. If not sure, don't modify it.
  default_stack_size: 4MB
  # Default heap size for each process. If not sure, don't modify it.
  default_heap_size: 32MB

# Entry points
# Specify all valid absolute <path> in `occlum run <path> <args>`.
# This prevents outside attackers from executing arbitrary commands inside an
# Occlum-powered enclave.
entry_points:
  - /bin

# Environment variables
#
# This gives a list of environment variables for the "root" process started
# by `occlum run` or `occlum exec` command.
env:
  # The default env vars given to each "root" LibOS process. As these env vars
  # are specified in this config file, they are considered trusted.
  default:
    - OCCLUM=yes
  # The untrusted env vars that are captured by Occlum from the host environment
  # and passed to the "root" LibOS processes. These untrusted env vars can
  # override the trusted, default envs specified above.
  # For example, `OCCLUM=no occlum run xxx` can pass the env OCCLUM=no to the process
  # running in LibOS with below settings.
  #     env:
  #       default:
  #         - OCCLUM=yes
  #       untrusted:
  #         - OCCLUM
  untrusted:

# Enclave metadata
# If not sure, just keep them no change
metadata:
  # Enclave signature structure's ISVPRODID field
  product_id: 0
  # Enclave signature structure's ISVSVN field
  version_number: 0
  # Whether the enclave is debuggable through special SGX instructions.
  # If set to false, no log could be output.
  # For production enclave, it is IMPORTANT to set this value to false.
  debuggable: true
  # SGX Key Separation and Sharing feature support.
  # Please always keep it as true.
  enable_kss: true
  # Enclave signature structure's ISVEXTPRODID field.
  # It is separated as two 16 bytes strings.
  ext_prod_id:
    high: '0x0'
    low: '0x0'
  # Whether to turn on PKU feature in Occlum
  # Occlum uses PKU for isolation between LibOS and userspace program,
  # It is useful for developers to detect potential bugs.
  #
  # "pkru" = 0: PKU feature must be disabled
  # "pkru" = 1: PKU feature must be enabled
  # "pkru" = 2: PKU feature is enabled if the platform supports it
  pkru: 0

# Mount points and their file systems
mount:
  # RootFS mount point and file systems.
  # Generally, just don't change it.
  - target: /
    type: unionfs
    options:
      layers:
        # The read-only layer which is generated in `occlum build`
        - target: /
          type: sefs
          source: ./build/mount/__ROOT
          options:
            MAC: ''
        # The read-write layer whose content is produced when running the LibOS
        - target: /
          type: sefs
          source: ./run/mount/__ROOT
  #
  # HostFS mount
  # It provides a channel to exchange files between Host FS and LibOS FS.
  # Just note, with this mount, the files written to the target in the LibOS
  # is recognizable to users in the Host thus may introduce security issue.
  #
  # For example, below section mount the occlum_instance directory in the Host FS
  # to the path /host in the LibOS FS.
  # It is disabled in default. Uncomment it if you are very sure about it.
  # - target: /host
  #   type: hostfs
  #   source: .
  #
  # Async FS mount
  # - target: /sfs
  #   type: async_sfs
  #   source: ./run/async_sfs_image
  #   options:
  #     total_size: 4GB

# Untrusted Unix domain socket
# Besides the common Unix domain socket support that both ends are created in the same
# Occlum instance, the Untrusted Unix domain socket can support cross-world connection by
# mapping a libos socket address with the host socket address. In this way, a Unix domain
# socket created in Occlum can communicate with a Unix domain socket in the host OS or in
# another Occlum instance.
# Uncomment and customize below if you are very sure about it.
#
# untrusted_unix_socks:
# The libos path and the host path correspond to the same host sock file.
# The host side should use the host path and libos side should use the libos path.
#
# Specify socket file in absolute path
  # - host: /tmp/occlum/test.sock
  #   libos: /root/test.sock
# Or any files in the path
  # - host: /tmp/root/
  #   libos: /root/
# Or the host path can be a relative path and is relative to the current Occlum instance dir.
  # - host: ../test.sock
  #   libos: /tmp/test.sock
```

## Runtime Resource Configuration for Occlum process

Occlum has enabled per process resource configuration via [`prlimit`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages//man2/prlimit.2.html) syscall and shell built-in command [`ulimit`](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/ulimit.html).

```shell
#! /usr/bin/bash
ulimit -a

# ulimit defined below will override configuration in Occlum.yaml
ulimit -Ss 10240 # stack size 10M
ulimit -Sd 40960 # heap size 40M
ulimit -Sv 102400 # virtual memory size 100M (including heap, stack, mmap size)

echo "ulimit result:"
ulimit -a

# Run applications with the new resource limits
...
```
