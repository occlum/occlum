# Remote Attestation

Occlum provides wrapped library `libocclum_dcap` for `DCAP` remote attestion applications.
This Occlum DCAP library is prebuilt as part of the Occlum toolchains in the [Occlum Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/occlum/occlum).

The libraries are in the path `/opt/occlum/toolchains/dcap_lib`.
```
.
|-- glibc
|   |-- dcap_test
|   |-- libocclum_dcap.a
|   `-- libocclum_dcap.so
|-- inc
|   `-- occlum_dcap.h
`-- musl
    |-- dcap_test
    |-- libocclum_dcap.a
    `-- libocclum_dcap.so
```

Two versions (glibc and musl-libc), including static and dynamic libraries are provided to meet different scenarios. Unified header file `occlum_dcap.h` is provided as well in which defines the exported APIs for DCAP quote generation and verification.

In short, applications can link to the prebuilt `libocclum_dcap.so` and use the APIs defined in `occlum_dcap.h` for their usage.

For details how to use the library, please refer to the [`demo`](https://github.com/occlum/occlum/tree/master/demos/remote_attestation/dcap).

The source code of the library is in the [`path`](https://github.com/occlum/occlum/tools/toolchains/dcap_lib/).

Occlum also has a unique "Occlum -> init ->application" boot flow. Generally, all operation which is application required but not part of the application, such as remote attestation, could be put into `init` part. This feature makes Occlum highly compatible to any remote attestation solution without involving applicationâ€™s change.

This design off load the remote attestation burden from application. Two RA solutions are provided for reference.

## Init-RA solution

It is based on a GRPC-RATLS implementation.
Details please refer to the demo [`init_ra_flow`](https://github.com/occlum/occlum/tree/master/demos/remote_attestation/init_ra_flow).

## Azure Attestation

To support Azure Attestation, there are some demos provided. Users could choose each one to their actual applications. Details please refer to the demo [`azure_attestation`](https://github.com/occlum/occlum/tree/master/demos/remote_attestation/azure_attestation).

## SGX KSS (Key Separation and Sharing feature) support

Starting from SGX2, there is a new Key Separation and Sharing feature which provides more  flexibility. The new feature gives user a chance to fill in some meaningful information to the enclave either in the signing or running stage.

* Signning stage:
```
ISVFAMILYID, 16 bytes
ISVEXTPRODID, 16 bytes
```
* Running stage:
```
CONFIG ID, 64 bytes
CONFIG SVN, 16 bits
```
Occlum can support both above by either modifying the fields in `Occlum.yaml` (for `Signning stage`) or using Occlum run arguments `"--config-id"` or `"--config-svn"` (for `Running stage`).

* Note: `ISVFAMILYID` is reserved for saving the MAC of the configuration file.

Details please refer to the [RFC](https://github.com/occlum/occlum/issues/589).
