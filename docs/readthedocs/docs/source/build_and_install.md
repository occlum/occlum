# Build and Install

Generally, users don't need build the Occlum from source. They can directly use Occlum official docker image in Docker hub.
```
docker pull occlum/occlum:[version]-ubuntu20.04
```

## Build from Source

To build Occlum from the latest source code, do the following steps in an Occlum Docker container (which can be prepared as shown in the last section):

1. Download the latest source code of Occlum
    ```
    mkdir occlum && cd occlum
    git clone https://github.com/occlum/occlum .
    ```
2. Prepare the submodules and tools required by Occlum.
    ```
    make submodule
    ```
3. Compile and test Occlum
    ```
    make

    # test musl based binary
    make test

    # test glibc based binary
    make test-glibc

    # stress test
    make test times=100
    ```

    For platforms that don't support SGX
    ```
    SGX_MODE=SIM make
    SGX_MODE=SIM make test
    ```
4. Install Occlum
    ```
    make install
    ```
   which will install the `occlum` command-line tool and other files at `/opt/occlum`.

If `release` build and install is required, just add **OCCLUM_RELEASE_BUILD=1** in front of every `make` command.   
The Occlum Dockerfile can be found at [here](https://github.com/occlum/occlum/tree/master/tools/docker). Use it to build the container directly or read it to see the dependencies of Occlum.

## How to Build and Run Release-Mode Enclaves?

By default, the `occlum build` command builds and signs enclaves in debug mode. These SGX debug-mode enclaves are intended for development and testing purposes only. For production usage, the enclaves must be signed by a key acquired from Intel (a restriction that will be lifted in the future when Flexible Launch Control is ready) and run with SGX debug support disabled.

Occlum has built-in support for both building and running enclaves in release mode.
To do that, modify `Occlum.yaml` [metadata]-[debuggable] field to `false`. And then run the commands below:
```
$ occlum build --sign-key <path_to/your_key.pem>
$ occlum run <prog_path> <prog_args>
```

Ultimately, whether an enclave is running in the release mode should be checked and judged by a trusted client through remotely attesting the enclave. See the remote attestation demo [here](demos/remote_attestation).
