# gRPC

This directory contains the Makefile and the template manifest for the most
recent version of gRPC (as of this writing, version 3.18.0). This was tested
on a machine with SGX v1 and Ubuntu 18.04.

The Makefile and the template manifest contain extensive comments and are made
self-explanatory. Please review them to gain understanding of Gramine-SGX
and requirements for applications running under Gramine-SGX.
