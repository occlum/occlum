# Use Python with Occlum

This project demonstrates how Occlum enables _unmodified_ [Python](https://www.python.org) programs running in SGX enclaves, which is based on glibc.

## Sample Code: CSV Processing in Python

To make the sample code more realistic, we choose to write a Python program that processes CSV data files using [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org). The sample code can be found [here](demo.py).

## How to Run

This tutorial is written under the assumption that you have Docker installed and use Occlum in a Docker container.

Occlum is compatible with glibc-supported Python, we employ miniconda as python installation tool. You can import any python dependencies using conda. Here, miniconda is automatically installed by install_python_with_conda.sh script, the required python and related dependencies for this project are also loaded by this script. Here, we take occlum/occlum:0.23.0-ubuntu18.04 as example.

Step 1 (on the host): Start an Occlum container
```
docker pull occlum/occlum:0.23.0-ubuntu18.04
docker run -it --name=pythonDemo --device /dev/sgx/enclave occlum/occlum:0.23.0-ubuntu18.04 bash
```

Step 2 (in the occlum container): Download miniconda and install python to prefix position.
```
cd /root/occlum/demos/python/python_glibc
bash ./install_python_with_conda.sh
```

Step 3 (in the occlum container): Run the sample code on Occlum
```
cd /root/occlum/demos/python/python_glibc
bash ./run_python_on_occlum.sh
```
It will process CSV data files and generate a file (`smvlight.dat`) in `./occlum_instance`.
